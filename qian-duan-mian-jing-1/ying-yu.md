## 自我介绍Tell me a little about yourself

Thank you for this interview opportunity. I am so honored to be here. My name is \_\_\_ _, 29 years old. I graduated from_ \_\_\_. I majored in Software Engineering.

After I graduated, I joined in \_\_\_\_\_. My position is Front end architect. I implement front-end development workflows, including systems building`(choose framework, select project tools, transpiling and bundling code, css preprocessing)`, dependency management`(using npm - the Nodejs package manager to pack code into reusable modules. npm is the standard way to share code in the huge js community)` and quality checkers`(testing tools, task runners for linting)`

I evaluate new frameworks and tools that can be integrated into the existing applications without breaking previous implementations.`There are two conditions, 1. Upgrading a project to the latest version, will affects whole code at once. So I must be well aware of the impact weather having breaking changes, dependency issues, etc 2.Adding new tools or libraries usually along with new project features, we will control the entry of tools. Just like grayscale publishing`

I also manage a FE developer team with 7 menmbers. I make the schedule plan, project timelines, code review, to ensure product delivery. `After I made the workflow, I would hold a meeting to explain development mode, Ensure that everyone is aware of it and focus on the business logic development`
